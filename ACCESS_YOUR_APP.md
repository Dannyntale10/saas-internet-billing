Use the latest deployment URL from your Vercel dashboard:
- **Latest:** https://saas-internet-billing-i59rx7c4t-dannyntale10s-projects.vercel.app

### Option 2: Production URL (If Configured)
If you have a production domain set up:
- **Production:** https://saas-internet-billing.vercel.app

### Option 3: Custom Domain (If Configured)
- **Custom Domain:** https://jendamobility.gt.tc (if DNS is configured)

## 🚨 If You Get "Site Can't Be Reached" Error

### Solution 1: Use the Latest Deployment URL
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dannyntale10s-projects/saas-internet-billing
2. Click on the **latest deployment** (the top one)
3. Click the **"Visit"** button or copy the deployment URL
4. Use that URL to access your app

### Solution 2: Check Vercel Dashboard
1. Visit: https://vercel.com/dannyntale10s-projects/saas-internet-billing
2. Look for the **"Domains"** section
3. Check what domains are assigned to your project
